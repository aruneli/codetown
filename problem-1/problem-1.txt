The challenge is to be programmed in your language of choice (Python or Go). The invocation should be as follows:

./stock-optimizer aapl

And return the optimal purchase and sell dates for the given stock (aapl, in this example):

Buy: 10/26
Sell: 11/23

The data should be based on the past 1 month as given by this free API: https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#chart

Make sure to optimize as much as possible,
